This repository contains [EDA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_design_automation) source files describing, in part or whole, the electrical setup on the Yamaha Royal Star Venture XVZ1300TF motorcycle. The EDA files are in CadSoft Eagle 6 format and only the `.SCH` (schematic) is provided for obvious reasons. No guarantee is made as to which minor version of Eagle was used to save the file, but it *may* be the latest at the time of this writing.

All files included here are compatible with the free version of Eagle (i.e. describe schematics having no more than one sheet).
